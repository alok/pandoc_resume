## Projects

[BFF](https://www.textbff.com/): Built an iMessage app around ChatGPT with
10,000 users (Dec 2022)

[Voted article of the year by The Browser, over 100,000 reads](https://thebrowser.com/free/cadaver-speak/) (Nov 2022)

### Experience

**Research Resident, Redwood Research** (2023)

I am using my reinforcement and deep learning expertise to mechanistically
interpret AlphaGo with a team and probe its adversarial exploitability. We are finding that AlphaGo
often [decides its final move very
early](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FF8i6SLfKb4g7C4EL/inside-the-mind-of-a-superhuman-go-model-how-does-leela-zero-2) in its hidden layers.

**Deep Learning Scientist, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab** (2019-2022)

My first project at the lab involved leading a team to replace (slow) classical climate simulation models with GANs
and super-resolution. Simulation time dropped from 4 hours to 1 second. This
work was published at NeurIPS.

Within a year, I led a team of 10 researchers and programmers for a \$1,800,000 [ARPA-E DIFFERENTIATE
project](https://arpa-e.energy.gov/technologies/projects/deep-learning-and-natural-language-processing-accelerated-inverse-design).

I devised and directed us in building a differentiable electromagnetic
simulator in Julia. It evolved meshes to have specified desirable optical
properties—a hybrid of flexible deep learning and rigid
symbolic equations. It guided a
[laser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VraR6LVr0RA) to ablate materials to
specific emissivities (relevant e.g., to solar panels).

**Machine Learning Consultant, Papert Labs** (2018): Several others and I
consulted with Silicon Valley financial startups on using machine and
reinforcement learning.

**Recurse Center** (2017): A self-directed programmer's retreat. I taught myself
reinforcement learning and [implemented many algorithms](https://github.com/alok/rl_implementations/).

### Talks and Papers

[How to differentiate a discontinuous function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP-iTs5m3X0)

[Generalization Properties of Machine Learning Based Weather Model
Downscaling](https://ai4earthscience.github.io/iclr-2020-workshop/papers/ai4earth25.pdf),
ICLR 2020

[A reinforcement learning environment for mathematical reasoning via program
synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.07373.pdf). This used LLMs to output
math proofs (checked by the [Lean Theorem
Prover](https://leanprover.github.io/)) and was improved by reinforcement learning.

[Numerical Weather Model Super-Resolution](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2019/files/NeurIPS_ML4PS_2019_75.pdf), NeurIPS 2019
