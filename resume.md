## Relevant Experience

**Machine Learning Scientist, Terrafuse** (2019)

Replace (slow) classical climate simulation models with faster ones
using generative models.

**Machine Learning Consultant, Papert Labs** (2018)

Consulted companies on how to use ML. Worked on time series forecasting
and automating our ML pipeline, cutting runtime by 2 hours.

**Recurse Center** (2017)

Worked on deep reinforcement learning. Implemented DAgger, DQN, and
policy gradient methods. Also worked on metaheuristics such as genetic
algorithms and simulated annealing.

**Data Scientist Intern, Radius Intelligence** (2015)

Did EDA using Apache Spark. Integrated customer data with our own,
increasing total dataset size by 3x.

## Relevant Projects

**Network Compression**

Implemented model compression to test the conclusion of the paper
*Understanding Deep Learning Requires Rethinking Generalization*. Blog
post and code
[here](https://alok.github.io/2018/01/12/compressing-neural-networks-to-see-if-they-learn).

**Parallel PPO**

Optimized PPO to gather data in parallel and tuned to achieve superhuman
performance on Atari.

**DAgger**

Implemented and gave a talk about DAgger at the Recurse Center.

**Deep Q-Network**

Implemented DQN with optimizations to play Atari games to superhuman
levels.
