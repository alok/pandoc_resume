### Education

2013 - 2017

:   **Bachelor's, Mathematics, UC Berkeley**

### Experience

**Research Resident, Redwood Research** (2023)

Program was 1 month experiment in rapid mechanistic interpretability research. I
researched AlphaGo with another, and we probed its adversarial exploitability.
We found AlphaGo often decides its final move very early in its hidden layers.

**Deep Learning Scientist, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab** (2020-2022)

I joined as a software engineer, but within a few months I came to lead the machine learning for a \$1,800,000 ARPA-E DIFFERENTIATE project.

I led us to build a differentiable electromagnetic simulator for metamaterial inverse design. This is thousands of times faster than the traditional approach of guess and check.

**Machine Learning Scientist, Terrafuse** (2019-2020)

I led 2 others to replace (slow) classical climate simulation models with faster ones using GANs and super-resolution. Simulation time dropped from 4 hours to less than a second. This work was accepted at NeurIPS.

**Recurse Center** (2017): A self-directed programmer's retreat. I taught myself reinforcement learning and [implemented 11 algorithms](https://github.com/alok/rl_implementations/).

### Skills

-   Python, Math, Reinforcement Learning, Rust, Theorem Proving, Julia, PyTorch, Bash
